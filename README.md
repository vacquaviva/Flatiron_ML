### Flatiron_ML

This is a collection of materials (short notebook to visualize the decision tree(s), data - coming from http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog, and slides that I didn't actually use but mirror the discussion) I used in the April 26 class of the Computational Data Analysis course (http://dwh.gg/FlatironCDA) at the Flatiron Institute.
